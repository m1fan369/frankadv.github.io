<p>You gather your courage and finally ask, "Who are you?" The words hang in the air, but the figure doesn't respond right away. Instead, a cold smile curls at the edges of their lips, and then, in a voice that seems to echo inside your mind, they speak:<p>
<br>
    <p>"You are me, and I am you."</p> 
    <br>
    <p>The statement reverberates through you, a chilling, impossible concept that shatters everything you thought you understood. The woods around you grow quieter, as if the world itself is holding its breath. Your mind races, trying to make sense of the words, but nothing adds up. How could this person, this stranger, be you? The more you think about it, the more the lines between you and them blur, leaving you with only confusion and a creeping sense of dread.</p>

Rubbing your eyes, you slowly realized, you are sitting right outside your house. In the house, through the windows, you see a man, which isn't anyone but you - answering a call.</button></a>
