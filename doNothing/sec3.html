<p>You approach cautiously, the figure standing motionless in the dark woods. Something about them feels unsettlingly familiar, but you can’t quite place it. As you get closer, you see the same strange posture, the same distant gaze you saw when you were hiding earlier. The realization hits: this person is the same one you watched through your window, the one who had been silently observing you, and now, here they are again, standing in front of you. They don’t speak, only watch, as though waiting for something—perhaps a decision, a reaction from you. The silence between you feels thick, almost suffocating, as the woods around you remain eerily still.</p>
