    <h2>CURRENT LOCATION: In the forest</h2>
    <div class="text">
<p>Curiosity and unease propel you forward as you call out, “Hello?” Your voice cuts through the stillness, but the figure doesn’t respond or even flinch. The closer you get, the more you notice their unsettling stillness—it’s as though they’re not entirely real, like a shadow or a memory frozen in time. You reach out tentatively, driven by an almost magnetic need to understand, but as you draw near, the figure finally moves. Slowly, they turn their head toward you, and the dim light reveals something impossible: the face staring back at you is your own.</p>
