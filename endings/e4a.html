<p>You wake up in the morning, still feeling the aftermath of last night’s pizza. What seemed like a good choice at the time quickly turned into a nightmare. Your stomach churns as you rush to the bathroom, only to find that the trouble isn’t over yet. The whole day is spent in a frantic back-and-forth battle with your body, and you’re late for work, scrambling to get ready while dealing with the constant discomfort. Despite the chaos, you make it through the day—barely. In the end, you’re just thankful you made it out alive, but next time... maybe skip the late-night </p>
